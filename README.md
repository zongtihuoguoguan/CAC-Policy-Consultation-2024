<h1>CAC POLICY CONSULTATION</h1>

This repository contains all the code and datasets collected and processed for the CAC POLICY CONSULTATION project. It primarily relies on Python and Jupyter Notebooks. It is provided to the public for reuse and review.

The project consists of two parts:
- The data of all CAC policies to-date and their matching drafts (CAC.xlsx)
- The Python Jupyter Notebook for analysis
